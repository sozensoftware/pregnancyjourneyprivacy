Pregnancy Journey - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: July 11, 2025
1. Introduction
Sozen Software ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Pregnancy Journey mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with the utmost care and transparency. Your trust is essential to us.
2. Our Privacy Principles
Your privacy is at the core of our application. The data you enter is personal and sensitive, and we treat it that way.
Local-First Data: All your personal health and pregnancy-related data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not upload it to our servers.
Minimal Data Collection: We only collect what is absolutely necessary to provide and improve the app's functionality.
Transparency: We clearly explain what data we collect and why.
3. Information We Collect and How We Use It
3.1. Your Pregnancy Data (Stored Locally on Your Device)
When you use the tools within Pregnancy Journey, you provide data that is crucial for the app to function. This data is NOT transmitted to our servers and remains on your device.
What we collect: Your current pregnancy week, weight and blood pressure measurements, kick counts, contraction timings, water intake, items for your hospital bag, Kegel exercise progress, and any other information you enter into the app's tools.
Why we collect it: This information is essential for the core functionality of the app, allowing you to track your pregnancy progress, monitor your health, and use the tools effectively.
How we handle it: All of this personal data is stored locally and securely on your device using standard application storage methods. We, the developers, have no access to this information. If you uninstall the app, this data is permanently deleted from your device.
3.2. Premium Subscriptions
What is processed: If you choose to subscribe to Pregnancy Journey Premium, the financial transaction is processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not see, receive, or store your payment card details.
Third-Party Service (RevenueCat): To manage subscription status and verify purchases, we use a trusted third-party service called RevenueCat. RevenueCat provides us with an anonymous user ID which allows us to confirm if you have an active "premium" entitlement. This lets us unlock the premium features for you without ever knowing your personal identity or payment information.
3.3. Non-Personal Analytics Data
What we collect: To improve our Service, we may collect anonymous, aggregated, non-personal data. This can include crash reports, app performance data (e.g., how fast screens load), device type (e.g., "iPhone 15"), and general usage patterns (e.g., which tools are most frequently used).
Why we collect it: This information is vital for us to understand how our app is performing, to identify and fix bugs, and to make the user experience better for everyone. This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify you.
4. Data Security
The security of your data is a top priority. Since all sensitive health data is stored locally on your device, its security is primarily handled by your device's operating system (iOS or Android). Any communication with our third-party service provider (RevenueCat) for subscription validation is performed over industry-standard encrypted connections (HTTPS). While we take all reasonable measures, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
5. Children's Privacy
Our Service is intended for adults and is not directed at anyone under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided us with any data, please contact us immediately so we can take the necessary steps to remove that information.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
