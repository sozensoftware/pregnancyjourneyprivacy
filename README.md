Pregnancy Journey - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: July 11, 2025
1. Introduction
Sozen Software ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Pregnancy Journey mobile application (the "Service"). As the Data Controller, we are responsible for your information. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with the utmost care and transparency. Your trust is essential to us.
2. Our Privacy Principles
Your privacy is at the core of our application. The data you enter is personal and sensitive, and we treat it that way.
Local-First Data: All your personal health and pregnancy-related data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not upload, access, or store this data on our servers.
Minimal Data Collection: We only collect what is absolutely necessary to provide and improve the app's functionality.
3. Information We Collect and How We Use It
3.1. Your Pregnancy Data (Stored Locally on Your Device)
This data is essential for the app's core functionality and is NOT transmitted from your device.
What we collect: Your current pregnancy week, weight and blood pressure measurements, kick counts, contraction timings, water intake, items for your hospital bag, Kegel exercise progress, and any other notes or symptoms you enter.
How we handle it: All of this personal data is stored securely on your device. We, the developers, have no access to this information.
3.2. Subscription and Purchase Information
What is processed: If you subscribe to Pregnancy Journey Premium, the transaction is processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not receive or store your payment details.
Third-Party Service (RevenueCat): To manage subscription status, we use a trusted third-party service called RevenueCat. RevenueCat provides us with an anonymous user ID which allows us to confirm your "premium" entitlement without accessing your personal identity or payment information.
3.3. Non-Personal Analytics Data
What we collect: To improve our Service, we use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous, aggregated, non-personal data. This includes crash reports, app performance data (e.g., how fast screens load), device type (e.g., "iPhone 15"), and general usage patterns (e.g., which tools are most frequently used).
Why we collect it: This information is vital for us to identify and fix bugs and improve the user experience. This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify you.
4. Your Data Rights (GDPR & CCPA)
We recognize and respect your privacy rights. Since your sensitive health data is stored locally on your device, you have direct control over it.
Right to Access, Rectify, and Portability: You can access and update your information directly within the app at any time.
Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You can permanently delete all your personal data at any time by simply uninstalling the application from your device.
Right to Object and Restrict Processing: Since the data is local, you control its processing. You can stop providing data to any feature at any time. For analytics, you can manage data collection settings where provided by your device's operating system.
5. Data Retention
We do not store your personal health data on our servers, so there is no retention period on our end. The data remains on your device for as long as you keep the application installed. The anonymous identifier managed by RevenueCat for your subscription status is retained only for as long as you have an active or expired subscription, for the purpose of restoring your purchase.
6. Data Security
The security of your data is a top priority. Sensitive health data is protected by your device's native operating system security (iOS or Android). Any communication with our third-party service providers (RevenueCat, Firebase) is performed over industry-standard encrypted connections (HTTPS). While we take all reasonable measures, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
7. International Data Transfers
Our third-party service providers (RevenueCat, Google) may process and store anonymous data on servers located outside of your home country. These providers are compliant with major data protection frameworks like the GDPR to ensure your data is handled securely.
8. Children's Privacy
Our Service is intended for adults and is not directed at anyone under the age of 16 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided us with any data, please contact us immediately.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
